App Identity: CoList (Web/PWA) Core Mission: Streamline group meal coordination by replacing chaotic group chats with a structured, real-time shared workspace.

Key Workflows:

Frictionless Onboarding: Hosts create an event and share a "magic link". Guests join immediately via the link with no account creation or app download required.
Collaborative Menu Planning:
Potluck Mode: Guests explicitly "claim" responsibilities (e.g., "I'll bring the dessert") to prevent duplicates.
Vacation Mode: Supports multi-day meal planning (Lunch/Dinner) for longer stays.
AI-Powered Utility:
Ingredient Generation: Users input a dish name (e.g., "Lasagna for 12"), and the integrated AI generates a precise list of ingredients with quantities adapted to the guest count.
Smart Shopping List:
Aggregates all ingredients from claimed dishes globally or per person.
Automatically categorizes items by supermarket aisle (Produce, Dairy, etc.).
Real-time coordination ensures items aren't bought twice.
Technical & Design Philosophy:

Mobile-First & Premium: Designed with a "utilitarian but beautiful" aesthetic, featuring high-end UI details (glassmorphism, micro-animations) while remaining functional on mobile devices.
International: Fully localized in 12+ languages (EN, FR, ES, etc.).
Tech Stack: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Drizzle ORM, SQLite.
One-line Pitch for LLM Context: "CoList is a mobile-first, collaborative meal planning app that uses AI to convert dish names into shopping lists and allows guests to coordinate contributions in real-time via a simple link, without requiring accounts."
